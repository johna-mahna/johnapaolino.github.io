    "reporting": "This project was originally developed by one of our data scientists. The application depended solely on URL query parameters so as more business intelligence teams started using it, there was a need for a more accessible front-end. I traveled to portland for a month, and worked with our data scientist to build out a front-end. We introduced a simple side menu that allowed users to quickly adjust the URL queries by a number of different dimensions. The application was build in Clojure / Clojurescript, using the OM framework.",
    "pub": "Our configuration database was being represented very literally as lists across a number of pages. This made it difficult for internal users to understand hierarchy. This application created a clear structure. There was a lot of attention was spent in UX safety. Previously, these configurations were too easy to adjust, but this UI introduced concepts like “unlocking” to make changes, and confirming saves to assure safe client relationships.",
    "builder": "Used across 4 teams. Wanted to inspire users to play and get creative with our ad offerings. Most client facing product."
