  "process": {
    "general": "I’ve developed a range of techniques to help lead an effective product design process. Great products involve design decisions at a number of nested layers and cut points. I see myself as a facilitator helping stakeholders realize the best solutions. Depending on the scale of the project and team, I adapt my tooling towards artifacts that will best bridge the gap between design and development. I have found value in separating the stages of the process into the following main concerns.",
    "research": "The goal of research is to identify the blocks of the user. I utilize a number of collaborative activities that help users guide me in understanding their needs. Defining and articulating the design problem is critical to the downstream success of the project. I usually find discussions over SwimLane Diagrams the most successful because it helps maintain a more generic representation of the problem without leaping to experience solutions.",
    "ideas": "I’m a big believer in sharing early and often. I deliver rough ideas back to users and stakeholders as quickly as possible. The goal of this phase of the design is to communicate the most succinct solutions so that we can build consensus in the right direction.",
    "collaborate": "Once there is clear direction, I like stakeholders to maintain active participation. At Yieldbot, we have a fairly distributed team so I encourage collaboration over shared documents as a best practice. This also has the benefit of producing clear artifacts.",
    "execute": "By this point, there is a clear solution, and specs can focus on micro-interaction details. If this process is executed successfully, engineers and product alike don’t get overloaded by specs because we’ve achieved clear direction early in the process."
  },
  "projects": {
    "general": "As a previous member of the front-end team at Yieldbot, I have a strong technical understanding of our applications. I have been deeply involved not only in design but also front-end implementation. I find huge value in having awareness of the different implementation cut points. This technical understanding helps inform my design decisions as well as facilitate an enjoyable ease of communication among the developers I work with.",
    "reporting": "This project was originally developed by one of our data scientists as a dev tool for exploring potential reporting joins. As business intelligence teams realized the application’s capabilities, they required it daily but were limited by its technical user experience. I traveled out to Portland for a month to work with one of our data scientists to build out a more accessible front-end solution. We introduced an unobtrusive side menu that allowed users to quickly automate URL parameters through familiar (and fun) dimensions.",
    "reporting_role": "This application was written in Clojurescript using Om.",
    "pub": "Previously, our configuration database was being represented very literally. There was little validation around model changes leading to mistakes that could compromise client relationships. The new application design aimed to introduce safety measures and clarity.",
    "pub_role": "This application was built using React.js.",
    "builder": "This application needed to meet a number of organizational objectives. We wanted an application that could be used by a number of teams in a pre-sales workflow, but also inspire users across our company to get creative with our ad offerings.",
    "builder_role": "Design + Ongoing UX Development",

  },
  "brand": {
    "general": "Most of my work at Yieldbot has been focused on Application Design and Development. However, in my first year at the company, I was responsible for unifying Yieldbot’s brand and marketplace identity.",
    "collateral": "I created a range of sales collateral establishing the Yieldbot’s aesthetic in the marketplace.",
    "website": "I worked closely with the CEO and CPO to design our new corporate website. I was responsible for the site-mapping through CSS specs.",
    "guide": "I’ve allowed the work I’ve done establishing Yieldbot’s aesthetic to translate into our interface products. Lately, I have been focusing effort on a front-end style guide. Having been a member of the front-end team, I am aiming at a solution that's easy for developers to integrate into our build process."

  "about": {
    "architecture": "At Yale, I majored in architecture. Opposed to papers which were so often shared privately with professors, architecture projects were presented to the entire class. The rigor required to reach this level of completion challenged the limits of my creativity while forcing clear execution.",
    "ramsa": "I was lucky enough to get a job working for the Dean of the Yale School of Architecture, Robert A.M. Stern. I worked at his studio for a little over two years where I focused work on multi-story residential buildings. These projects introduced a layer of complexity never covered in school. I loved working as part of a creative team to reach the best potential design solutions for the client.",
    "yieldbot": "Although I loved architecture, I realized the 7-10 year timelines of the projects I worked on didn’t match my creatively ambitious appetite. Fortunately, a lot of the design thinking of architecture translated to user experience and product design. The same creativity, analysis and design rigor existed, now in two dimensional plane and a quicker iterative loop. As I mentioned, architecture projects took years to reach construction documents. However, I was quickly dazzled working in tech as I saw ideas transform into code in such rapid cycles. ",
    "code": "At Yieldbot, I’ve had the opportunity to lead product design as well as grow my engineering skills. I have been fortunate enough to work with skilled and accessible developers who have challenged me to grow my engineering expertise. I now value my understanding of code just as an architect does construction requirements. I find huge value in having awareness of the different implementation cut points. This depth has helped inform my design decisions as well as facilitate enjoyable ease of communication among the developers I work with.",
    "nextUp": "I'm always interested in learning about creative projects."
