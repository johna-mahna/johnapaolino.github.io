      <h3>Uncubed: Company Page</h3>
      <div>
        Uncubed is a reimagined job board that more intimately connects candidates with companies. I worked with them to create their company page: a unique page for each of their clients. The page is templated so that depending on how many resources a company has to feature, there is still a consistent look and feel across pages. The page was designed to feature the company's sizzle reel, an exclusive video that candidates can watch for a behind-the-scenes look at a company. Uncubed wanted their brand to be clear while still highlighting the brand of the featured company.
