      <h3>Campaign Optimization Interface</h3>
      <div>
        At Yieldbot, a team of Ad Optimizers were responsible for building and optimizing active display advertising campaigns across our available inventory. Each Optimizer managed around 20-30 campaigns in active flight, so the interface was focused around making data visualizations quick and easy to understand.

        Many wireframes and iterations took place isolating the layouts and visualization techniques that would be most legible for users.

        The layout of the interface ended up maximizing vertical space, squishing UI elements and taking on a control center type of feel so that the campaign could be understood without a need to scroll.

      <div>
        The interface had to be legible for execs and other internal Yieldbot stakeholders, while providing robust functionality for the optimizers to isolate campaign performance issues. In order to help prioritize and understand the different stakeholders, we took on exercises diagraming the campaign flight process.

        This was a very collaborative experience, which involved a number of group-think exercises to build consensus.
