        This application lives at the front desk of General Assembly&#39;s 18 locations and provides a quick list view of upcoming free events.
        Students hanging around campus can browse and sign up for relevant events.
        This application helped to alleviate a lot of time the front desk staff was spending fielding questions regarding happenings on campus.

        The existing iPads on campus were previously set to the website homepage. This application provides a more relevant physical artifact for students to interact with at our campus locations.
        The list view is intentionally simple and pulls only geo-specific free events from the iPads location.

        The success screen is set on a timer, mimicing other existing UX patterns set by card reader applications.
        I focused keenly on the visual design elements for the iPad screen. Often as a designer, the starting point is mobile-first, so focusing in the middle was a fun change of pace.
